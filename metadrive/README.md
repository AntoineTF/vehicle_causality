# **MetaDrive Integration in This Project**

This project makes use of [MetaDrive](https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive), an open-source driving simulator designed for AI and autonomy research.

MetaDrive provides features such as:
- **Compositional Maps:** Procedural generation of diverse traffic scenarios.
- **Realistic Physics:** Including Lidar, RGB sensors, and collision models.
- **Lightweight Design:** Runs efficiently on standard hardware.
